        <p>
            <br>SPY x FAMILY Part 2, Episode 8 will be released on Saturday, November 19, 2022. The local time at which you will be able to stream the new episode will depend entirely 
            on where you are in the world. Crunchyroll has confirmed to us that the recent November time change doesn’t play into when the series airs on their platform. With that in mind,
             here is the release time for various time zones across the globe:</br>
        </p>

        <p>8:30 a.m. Pacific Time - 9:30 a.m. Mountain Time - 10:30 a.m. Central Time - 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time - 4:30 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time - 9:00 p.m. Indian Standard Time</p>

        <p>
            <br>SPY x FAMILY Part 2 has been confirmed to include 13 episodes in total, which means we are racing towards the final batch of episodes. Of course, with the popularity of 
            the anime series, and the manga on which it is based, it looks likely that a Part 3, potentially stylized as Season 2, could be on the horizon..</br>

            <br>The series tells the story of Agent Twilight, who puts together a fake family in a bid to infiltrate an elite private school. What he didn’t realize in doing so, was that
             his wife was a highly-skilled assassin, and his adopted daughter was a young psychic, all also in need of a cover family. Now, with Bond the precognitive dog also on their 
             side, they have all the tools they need at their disposal, to bring down the corruption and terrorism plaguing Ostania and beyond.</br>
